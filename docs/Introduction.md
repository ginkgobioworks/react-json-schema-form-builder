This repository contains code for a React JS Component called the `FormBuilder` that allows a user to visually drag, drop, and edit card elements corresponding to a JSON schema encoded form. This component is wrapped around a demo app that demonstrates how the tool can be used in conjunction with a code editor and [Mozilla's React JSON schema form viewer](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) to build a form and maintain a live, code representation of it in real time.
