# Philosophy

The Form Builder follows much of the same logic of the [JSON Schema form encoding](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that it's based on, but abstracts away the manual coding element for a flexible visual form building experience. 

One of the key abstractions is rendering form elements by parsing the `properties`, `definitions`, and `dependencies` sections of standard JSON Schema form code into discrete elements, that can be rerranged and edited in a manner similar to other standard form building solutions.
